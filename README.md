# Logistic-Regression-with-R
In this project we will be working with the UCI adult dataset. We will be attempting to predict if people in the data set belong in a certain class by salary, either making &lt;=50k or >50k per year. This project will try to reflect that by showing different issues that may arise when cleaning data.
